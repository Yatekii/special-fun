===========

Special functions for Rust by binding to the CEPHES library.

This implements the "Elusive Eight" special functions useful for statistics, as advocated in [1]. For this, the CEPHES library [2] is used. While it is not explicitly stated on [2], CEPHES has been BSD licensed in the past [3], [4].
